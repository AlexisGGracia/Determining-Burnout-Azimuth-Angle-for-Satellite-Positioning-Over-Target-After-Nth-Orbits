# Determination of the Burnout Azimuth Angle to Position a Satellite Over a Selected Location on Earth After Nth Orbital Periods in MATLAB

# Introduction

This project utilizes Ms. Katherine Johnson's NASA technical notes to determine the burnout azimuth angle required for a spacecraft to position itself over a desired location on Earth after a specific number of orbital periods accounting for J2 pertubations. The simulation was implemented in MATLAB and is designed for satellite mission planning. It calculates the orbital elements necessary to position the spacecraft for applications such as reconnaissance, Earth observation, or reentry positioning.

Who is it for? This project was developed at The University of Texas at Austin as part of my Final Project for my Spacecraft Dynamics course taken during Fall 2023

# Code Breakdown and Workflow

This section provides a detailed explanation of the logic and steps involved in the code.

1. **Defines parameters such as semi-major axis, eccentricity,  Greenwich Sidereal Meridian Time (GMST) at burnout ETC, latitude/longitude at burnout , latitude/longitude at desire location, constants etc**
     - Orbital elements such as semi-major axis, eccentricity are determined based on mission constraints such as altitude of orbiting spacecraft and desire orbit type
     -  Parameters defined are as follow:
       ```MATLAB
          %defining parameters
          format longG
          a = 6500;                       %semi-major axis (km)
          e = 0.001;                      %Orbit's eccentricity
          theta1 = 20*pi/180;             %initial true anomally at burnout
          GSMT = 0;                       %Greenwich Siderial meridian time at burnout
          mu_earth = 398600.4415;         %Gravitational parameter of earth (km^3/s^2)
          R_earth = 6378.1363;            %Radius of earth (km)
          J2 = 0.0010826267;              %J2 perturbations due to earths's oblaqueness
          w_earth = 2*pi / 86164 ;        %Earth's rotation rate
          n = 10;
          iterations = 4;
          i = 1;                         %counting variable
          f = 3.353*10^-3;               %Earth's Oblaqueness Constant
          height = 0;

3. **Extract the information required such as degrees, minutes, seconds, distance, and directions from the `.txt` file.**

4. **Include an if statement that checks if there is any missing information in case the code failed to extract all the required information.**
    - In this section, it checks for the length of degrees, minutes, seconds, distance, and directions.
    - If the code successfully extracts all the information, it continues. Otherwise, it prompts a warning sign with hints to help debug the location of the problem.

5. **Convert the given coordinates and distances such as "North 26Â°25'30" East - 15.6 ft" to Cartesian XY points.**
    - To do so, we need to find the bearing angles to convert from polar coordinates to XY points.
    
    **Steps to convert from DMS to XY points:**
    ```python
    # Find the decimal degree
    decimal_degree = degrees + (minutes / 60) + (seconds / 3600)
    
    # Convert decimal degree to bearing angle:
    if directions are NE:
        bearing_angle = decimal_degrees
    if directions are SE:
        bearing_angle = 180 - decimal_degrees
    if directions are SW:
        bearing_angle = 180 + decimal_degrees
    if directions are NW:
        bearing_angle = 360 - decimal_degrees
    ```

6. **Convert from polar coordinates to XY points:**

    **Steps:**
    ```python
    angle = 90 - bearing_angle
    X = distance * cos(angle)
    Y = distance * sin(angle)
    ```

7. **Pass the XY points to the `arcpy.da.InsertCursor` function to plot the XY points as polygons.**

    **Steps:**
    - Define a database.
    - Define a feature class (Example: `TraversedLines`).
    - Define a spatial reference (2278 corresponds to South Texas Central and should be changed based on the desired geographic location).
    - Define a polygon using the points (make sure the first and last points are the same to close the polygon).
    - Use `arcpy.da.InsertCursor` to access the traverse tool and insert the XY points for each row.

### Important Notes:
- Your starting point and your last point generated should be the same to close the polygon.
- Additionally, when computing your XY points, you need to use the previous point as your new starting point for the next XY points. Otherwise, your shape will be inaccurate.

  
## Requirements 
To run this project, you will need the following software and tools:

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **ArcGIS Pro**: You will need ArcGIS Pro to run the script and use its mapping features. You can get it from [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro).
- **ArcPy**: This Python library is used for automating GIS workflows in ArcGIS Pro. It comes pre-installed with ArcGIS Pro.
- **Additional Python Libraries**:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `re`
  - `math`
  - `datetime`
  - `os`

You can install the Python libraries using `pip`:

`pip install numpy matplotlib pandas`
# Visual Results
In this section, I have included images that demonstrates the final product of my code. The green figures were made manually which takes about 2-5 minutes to generate. The figure with a distinct color was made using my code automatically which takes less than 3 seconds to generate.

## Green Color Figure: 
    Corresponds to a manually drawn parcel (2-5 minutes to generate)

## Distinct Color Figure: 
    Corresponds to the parcel generated by my code (less than 3 seconds to generate)
